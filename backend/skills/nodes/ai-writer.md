# AI Agent

> **Deprecated node type.** `ai-writer` is a legacy type — the editor auto-migrates
> it to `llm-chat` on workflow load. The backend still executes `ai-writer` for
> in-flight / server-side runs, so this skill is kept for `get_node_skill("ai-writer")`.
> For new workflows use `llm-chat` (chat/completion) or `generate-script` (multi-prompt).

<!-- AUTO-GEN:START node-data-shape -->
**Type:** `ai-writer`
**Category:** ai
**Credit cost:** priced by the chosen LLM tier (`ai-writer:economy` / `ai-writer` / `ai-writer:premium`) — the live price is `GET /v1/credits/model-cost?model=<id>` (MCP: `list_models`).
**Inputs (target handles):** `in`
**Outputs (source handles):** `text`

**Default data:**
```json
{
  "label": "AI Agent",
  "templateId": "custom",
  "systemPrompt": "",
  "userInput": "",
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "maxTokens": 4096,
  "fieldMappings": {}
}
```

> **This block is frozen, and hand-maintained below.** `ai-writer` no longer
> appears in `NODE_DEFINITIONS` (the editor migrates it to `llm-chat`), so
> `gen:skills` cannot regenerate this file — it was last generated 2026-05-18
> and the generator silently skips it. The `/v1/ai-writer` route is still live
> and has gained fields since. Anything below this line is maintained by hand.

**Additional accepted fields** (present on the route, absent from the frozen
block above):

- `llmModel?: string` — any id from the LLM model registry.
- `reasoningEffort?: "none" | "low" | "medium" | "high" | "xhigh" | "max"` —
  clamped to what the chosen model declares. `xhigh`/`max` bill one tier up.
- `advancedMode?: boolean` — Gemini models only. Runs the request on the
  provider's own API so `temperature` / `maxTokens` / the full reasoning range
  actually apply. Bills one credit tier up. Sending it with a non-Gemini model
  returns `400 advanced_mode_unsupported`.
