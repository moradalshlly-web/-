 * prediction it re-fetched. Without this, a stalled whisper job hit
 * `reconcile/replicate.ts`'s URL extraction, found none in
 * `{transcription, segments}` / `{text, chunks}`, and was force-failed +

 *
 * No I/O, no imports from the provider client — these must stay pure so both
 * the live path and the recovery path can call them.
 *
 * Input shapes below mirror the ORIGINAL `transcribe.ts` local interfaces
 * (verified against `captions-mappers.ts`'s `WhisperSegment`/`FastWhisperOutput`
 * and the live audio-wrappers.test.ts fixtures, not the shape guessed in the
 * task brief): openai/whisper segments carry a mandatory `id`. Omitting it
 * here would fail to typecheck against `whisperWordsToCaptions`'s own local
 * (unexported) `WhisperSegment`, which requires it.
