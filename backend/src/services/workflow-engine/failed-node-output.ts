/**
 * The ONE way a FAILED node's `NodeExecutionState.output` is produced.
 *
 * A run can refuse its result and still RETAIN what it produced. The 3D-scene
 * authoring lanes are the motivating case: once the repair budget is spent and
 * the visual reviewer refuses the scene, the job settles `failed` under
 * `SCENE_QUALITY_FAILED` — but the planner produced a recipe, the compiler
 * accepted it, the builder exported it, and `jobs.output_data` carries the
 * draft (`scenePlan`, `sceneRevisionId`, `deliveryId`, `posterAssetId`,
 * `validation`, `metadata.review`). That revision was billed and published.
 * A run whose visual review never reached its provider retains the same shape
 * under `SCENE_REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE`, minus the `metadata` block — a scene NOBODY
 * judged, whose `validation.warnings[]` leads with that code instead. Neither
 * error code appears below, which is why the second one needed no change.
 * Until this existed, every emitter of a failed node state built a fresh
 * object with `status`, `error` and nothing else, so the draft reached no
 * client — the canvas showed a bare refusal for a scene it had paid for.
 *
 * Deliberately DATA-DRIVEN, never keyed on a node-type list: it asks
 * `buildNodeOutputFromJobData` — the same extractor the COMPLETED path uses —
 * what the row actually carries, and answers `undefined` when that is nothing.
 * A new node type that starts retaining a result on failure is covered the day
 * its output keys are extractable, with no list to remember.
 *
 * Consumers gate on the FIELD, not on the status: presence of `output` on a
 * failed node never means the node succeeded.
 *
 * @param outputData `jobs.output_data` of the failed row (any shape, incl. null)
 * @param nodeType   the node's type, for the extractor's type-specific branches

 * attaches `errorCode` and `errorHint`). This is the reader for that, and it
 * exists as a NAMED export so both emitters of a failed `NodeExecutionState`
 * import this one module: `failed-node-output-totality.test.ts` fails the build
