// NOTE (incident 2026-07-15): this handler only runs if the signal actually
// REACHES this process — start.sh must forward SIGTERM to its background
// children (it previously exec'd Caddy as PID 1, so node processes were
// SIGKILLed without ever draining and their BullMQ locks dangled for the
// full lockDuration). Keep worker.ts + start.sh in sync when touching either.
//
// The drain (lib/worker-shutdown.ts) flips the process drain BEFORE
// `worker.close()`:
//  - every in-flight provider POLL aborts at its next wait point (the shared
//    poll sleep in providers/kie/client.ts throws DrainAbortError), the
//    video-worker catch moves the job back to the queue at zero cost, and the
//    replacement container re-picks it seconds after boot;
//  - a private plugin's in-flight PAID stage (a Scene3D planner or critic
//    call) is NOT aborted — its response exists only in this process — so it
//    finishes and persists, and the plugin hands the job back at its next
//    stage boundary (the journal's `handOffOnDrain` claim option).
//
// The deadline is therefore the PLATFORM's window, not a fixed literal:
// `inFlightDrainDeadlineMs()` reads RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_DRAINING_SECONDS (minus
// a log-flush margin) and falls back to SHUTDOWN_DRAIN_MS when it is unset.
// Evidence 2026-09-15 (jobs 351f0270, 35bd1f1f): with the variable unset the
// container was killed ~11 s after SIGTERM while a planner call was 16–42 s
// into its up-to-360 s budget, and the successor failed and refunded the run.
