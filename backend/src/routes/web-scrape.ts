 * No Apify token of its own + a live nodaro.ai connection: the connection
 * runs the scrape (billed to the connected account) and this route relays
 * the result. RSS never needs Apify and is always fetched locally.
 *
 * The relay asks the cloud for the job id first and polls it, because the
 * cloud sits behind the same ~100 s edge timeout a browser does: held open, a
 * site crawl was cut off there while the cloud finished and billed the
 * connected account. A cloud that predates `respondAsync` ignores the flag and
 * answers when the work is done — that answer carries a `jobId` too, and the
 * poll finds the job already terminal, so a scrape UNDER the edge timeout reads
 * the same way against both generations. A longer one against such a cloud is
 * cut off exactly as it always was (this install fails and refunds its own job;
 * the connected account is still billed there) — no better, no worse.
 * The cloud job's `output_data` is the shape this route builds locally.
