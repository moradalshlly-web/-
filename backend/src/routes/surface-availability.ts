/**
 * The EFFECTIVE node/model availability for this deployment (B5) — the
 * browser mirror of the three-layer funnel lib/surface-deny.ts resolves
 * (edition/code → surface-profile factory → admin runtime override). The
 * static profile in /config.js cannot carry the runtime override, so the
 * picker and model dropdowns fetch this once and layer it over their local
 * profile fallback. The backend stays the authority either way: a stale
 * browser list is cosmetic (write/run still refuse).
 *
 * PER VIEWER (nodes). The admin switch hides a node from users, not from the
 * admins who run the deployment: an admin's `denied` list omits what the switch
 * withholds, and `hiddenFromUsers` names it so the picker can mark those — a
 * workflow built on one must not be mistaken for something users can run. A
 * non-admin always gets an empty `hiddenFromUsers`. The answer depends on the
 * caller, hence `private, no-store`.
 *
 * `webScrapeSources` is the same answer for a capability that lives INSIDE a
 * node: Web Scrape's Instagram source follows the Instagram node, and the
 * source dropdown hides what this lists. The rule itself stays here, in
 * lib/surface-deny.ts — the browser is told the result, never the mapping.
