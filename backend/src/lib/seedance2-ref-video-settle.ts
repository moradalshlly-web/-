/**
 * The BASE credits a Seedance 2 reference-video run actually billed, measured
 * from the clip the provider delivered — or `undefined` when there is nothing
 * to measure (no credits in this edition, another provider, neither a
 * reference video nor an Auto duration) or the measurement failed, in which case the caller commits the
 * reservation exactly as before (never under-bills).
 *
 * WHY: the reservation for such a run is a worst case. Seedance decides from
 * the prompt whether the run is a style run (renders the requested duration)
 * or an EDIT of the wired clip (renders the clip's own length, however long),
 * and the verdict is only known once the provider has spoken — so the reserve
 * holds the longer of the two and this measurement settles the difference.
 * Handed to `finalizeJobWithMedia` as `meteredBaseCredits` by every lane that
 * completes such a run: the i2v/t2v worker handlers and the reconcile cron's
 * generic recovery.
 *
 * `refVideoDurationsSec` is the reservation's own probe of the reference
 * clips, carried on the job (`input_data` and the queue payload) by both
 * reservation lanes; the settlement reads it instead of probing again.
 *
 * Core shim over the ee helper (dynamic import, the credit-guard pattern):
 * community/business never load a billing module.
