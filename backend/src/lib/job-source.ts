/**
 * Where did this job come from? — derived ONCE per request, from request
 * context only.
 *
 * Before this existed the only provenance marker was `jobs.mcp_client`, stamped
 * by hand at each insert site. Everything that wasn't MCP — the canvas, the
 * studio client, the CLI, the SDK, a published app, a raw API call — collapsed
 * to `null`, so an operator looking at a job could not tell a CLI run from a
 * browser run from an integration. `9d786dc2` (2026-07-29) was the question
 * that surfaced it.
 *
 * ## Two columns, on purpose
 *
 * `source` is a COARSE, closed vocabulary — the kind of caller. `source_detail`
 * is the SPECIFIC identity: the MCP client name, the browser origin host, the
 * client package + version, the developer-app id.
 *
 * That split is what keeps this from rotting. A host→label lookup table would
 * need a code change (and a deploy) every time a new subdomain ships, and the
 * failure mode is silent: the new surface just reports as something else. Here,
 * a brand-new `person.nodaro.ai` shows up in admin as
 * `web · person.nodaro.ai` the day it launches, with nothing added to this file.
 *
 * ## Precedence, and why it is this order
 *
 * Signals can legitimately co-occur — the MCP server calls our own routes over
 * HTTP, so an MCP-originated request also carries whatever transport headers
 * that hop sets. Precedence resolves that to the ORIGINATING surface:
 *
 *  1. `internal`  — the internal-orchestrator secret. Server-to-server; the
 *                   caller is us. Checked first because the orchestrator's own
 *                   HTTP hop would otherwise look like a plain API call.
 *  2. `mcp`       — `mcp_client` in the body, injected by every MCP tool.
 *  3. `app`       — a developer-app OAuth token (`req.appAuthorization`).
 *                   Beats the client header: what matters is WHICH integration,
 *                   not that it happened to use our SDK to get there.
 *  4. `extension` — an `Origin` with a browser-extension scheme
 *                   (`chrome-extension://…`, `moz-extension://…`,
 *                   `safari-web-extension://…`). A genuinely different KIND of
 *                   caller than `web`: the origin host is an opaque store id,
 *                   not a product domain, so grouping it under `web` buries it.
 *                   The trusted signal (the scheme) decides the KIND; an
 *                   `extension/<name>` client header — the one label browsers
 *                   let extension service workers set freely — only refines the
 *                   DETAIL to something human-readable.
 *  5. `web`       — an http(s) `Origin` header. Browsers always send it and
 *                   CORS already validates it, so it cannot be spoofed by a
 *                   page we don't serve. Non-browser callers never send it.
 *  6. `cli`/`sdk`/`extension` — the `X-Nodaro-Client` header the published
 *                   packages (or an extension without an Origin) send.
 *  7. `api`       — none of the above: a raw HTTP call, or an SDK/CLI old
 *                   enough to predate the header.
 *
 * ORIGIN ABOVE THE CLIENT HEADER is deliberate and was originally the other way
 * round, which was wrong. All six Nodaro client apps (studio / person / voice /
 * recast / recut / stitch) are browser SPAs built ON `@nodaro/sdk`, so they send
 * BOTH signals: `Origin: https://studio.nodaro.ai` and the SDK's default
 * `sdk/<version>`. With the header winning, every one of them would have
 * collapsed into an undifferentiated "SDK" the moment they bumped the
 * dependency — losing exactly the per-app visibility this feature exists to
 * provide. `Origin` names the actual product; `sdk/x.y.z` only says which
 * library it happened to use. The CLI is unaffected: Node sends no Origin, so
 * its explicit `cli/<version>` still applies.
 *
 * NOTE `workflow` is deliberately NOT derived here. A job that belongs to an
 * orchestrated run is identified by `workflow_execution_id` being set, which is
 * already a column and already exact. Re-deriving it into `source` would create
 * a second answer to the same question that can disagree with the first — and
 * would erase the more useful fact, which is what triggered the RUN (a schedule,
 * a webhook, MCP, a person clicking Run). `workflow_executions.trigger_type`
 * holds that. Admin should show both: the run's trigger and the job's caller.
