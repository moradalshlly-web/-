/**
 * The editor's cold-cache credit table must agree with the price table.
 *
 * `NODE_CREDIT_COSTS` in
 * `frontend/src/components/editor/workflow-editor/types.ts` is the fallback
 * every client-side quote uses while the live model-cost cache is cold: the
 * canvas node badges, the canvas total, the Run button and the pre-run confirm
 * dialog. It is a SECOND COPY of prices whose authority is `model_pricing`,
 * with `STATIC_CREDIT_COSTS` as the runtime fallback — so it drifts silently,
 * and when it drifts the user is quoted a number the run will not cost.
 *
 * It drifted exactly that way through the 2026-07-30 ×10 credit
 * re-denomination: the migration swept `STATIC_CREDIT_COSTS`, `model_pricing`,
 * `MODEL_CATALOG` and the video-analysis table and never touched that file, so
 * every fallback quoted a tenth of the real price and nothing failed.
 *
 * `frontend/…/__tests__/credit-estimate-tables.test.ts` pins the part a
 * frontend test can reach — the overlap with `MODEL_CATALOG`, which prices
 * MODELS. The node-type and composite rows (`add-captions:kinetic`,
 * `speed-ramp`, `image-collage`, …) have no catalog entry, and
 * `STATIC_CREDIT_COSTS` lives in `ee/` where the frontend cannot import it. So
 * the pin for those lives HERE, reading the table out of the frontend source —
 * the same shape as `docs-node-registry-parity.test.ts` reading `docs/`.
