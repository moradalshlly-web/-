/**
 * `max_words_per_line` on `add_captions`, and the doctrine move that paid for it.
 *
 * The lever caps the words a caption LINE (or tiktok-words page) may hold, on
 * top of the width budget — the one-or-two-words-at-a-time CapCut read. It
 * exists top-level AND per segment, and the MCP spelling is snake_case while
 * the payload the route takes is camelCase, so the mapping is worth pinning on
 * both.
 *
 * The second half is the reason the argument fits at all: `add_captions` had
 * been sitting ~45 B under the per-tool wire budget because its description
 * carried the DOCTRINE. That now lives in `backend/skills/nodes/add-captions.md`,
 * served by `get_node_skill`. Nothing true may be lost in a move, so the facts
 * that left the wire are asserted to be IN the skill — otherwise a trim reads
 * as a saving right up until the caller needs the sentence that was deleted.
