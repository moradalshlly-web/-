 * `elevenlabs-stt` was "the only enabled engine" and that whisper could no
 * longer be named — both went false when `/v1/transcribe` widened its enum to
 * all three lanes.
 *
 * Derived from the shared capability table rather than a hand-written list, so
 * a fourth engine fails this test instead of quietly shipping undocumented.
