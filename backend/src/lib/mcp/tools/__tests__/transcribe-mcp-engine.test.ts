/**
 * The MCP `transcribe` tool must run the engine it advertises.
 *
 * It always described itself as ElevenLabs STT (and exposes that engine's
 * diarize / audio-event options) but used to send NO `provider`, so the route's
 * fallback lane (`whisper`) served every call: `output_data.json.words` came back
 * `[]` on a job that reported success and charged credits, and the
 * diarize / tag options were silently ignored (2026-09-18 report). `whisper` has
 * no word-timestamp input in ANY published version, so the only honest fix on a
 * tool with no engine picker is to send a word-level engine explicitly — which
 * also makes the credit guard reserve on the id that actually runs.
