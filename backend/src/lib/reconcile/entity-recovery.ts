/**
 * Reconcile recovery for the entity studios (Character / Face / Object /
 * Creature / Location — main images, asset variants, motion clips).
 *
 * ## The bug this closes
 *
 * Every entity job type sat in `NOT_GENERIC_RECOVERABLE`, and all three
 * reconcile writers consult that set only AFTER a successful poll. So when a
 * worker died between "provider task created" and "result uploaded", the cron
 * polled the provider, got the FINISHED image back — and threw it away, bumped
 * `reconcile_attempts`, and ~90 minutes later force-failed the job and refunded
 * the user. We had already paid the provider; the asset existed upstream and
 * never reached the studio. By construction NO entity job whose worker died
 * mid-flight was recoverable (production evidence: two bursts of
 * `generate-object-asset` / `generate-character` rows, 2026-09-03 and
 * 2026-09-07, `reconcile_attempts: 18`, `reconcile_last_error: exhausted`).
 *
 * The denylist entry was correct about the CAUSE — generic
 * `finalizeJobWithMedia` writes `buildImageOutputData` + `createAssetFromJob`
 * and none of the studio-row writes, so it would have completed the job with
 * the result invisible in the studio. The fix is not to loosen that; it is to
 * give the reconciler the entity completion tail itself
 * (`lib/entity-finalize.ts`), which the live worker also calls. Same function,
 * same writes, no second implementation to drift.
 *
 * ## Contract
 *
 * Mirrors `finalizeJobWithMedia`'s guards, deliberately:
 *  - a terminal row is a graceful skip (never trample a cancel / a completion),
 *  - the `claim_job_finalize` CAS makes a losing finalizer exit BEFORE any
 *    media work (no duplicate download/upload of the same deterministic key),
 *  - the claim is released on a failed media step so the next tick can retry
 *    immediately instead of waiting out the TTL,
 *  - watermarking is the WORKER's expression (`hasCredits()`-gated), not
 *    finalize's, because this replays a worker completion.
 *
 * Throws on a failed upload/completion so the caller's
 * `bumpAttemptsOrExhaust` keeps its exhaustion-terminates-with-a-refund
 * property for a deterministically broken result.

/**
 * Complete an entity job from a recovered provider result.
 *
 * `jobType` must be an entity media type — callers gate on
 * `isEntityMediaJobType(row.job_type)` first, which is also what keeps this
 * lane and the `NOT_GENERIC_RECOVERABLE` denylist from ever double-handling a
 * row.
 *
 * DAG-origin rows are covered for free: `payload-builder`'s four entity
 * branches send NO attach fields at all and `node-executor` persists only
 * `{type, node_id, iterationIndex?}`, so both sides read an empty spec and the
 * recovered job completes with the media and no studio write — which is exactly
 * what the live worker does for those rows.
 *
 * The attach spec comes off `jobs.input_data` — the persisted request body,
 * which is the only thing that survives the worker's death. `entityAttachSpecFrom`
 * is the SAME reader the worker uses on its BullMQ payload, and the motion
 * columns the routes used to inline into that payload now live on the job
 * type's own entry in `ENTITY_MEDIA_JOB_SPECS`, so the recovered completion
 * attaches to exactly the column the worker would have.
