/**
 * The invariant behind `STALE_THRESHOLD_MS["anthropic-sync"]`.
 *
 * A sync LLM route holds its job row `pending` for exactly as long as the call
 * runs, and the reconciliation cron force-fails + refunds any row past its
 * kind's threshold. So the threshold is not a taste question: it must outlast
 * the longest run the route can legitimately produce, or the sweep kills a
 * LIVE draft and refunds under it — which is what happened on 2026-09-01
 * ("Reconciliation could not recover this job. Please re-run.", a studio
 * Director draft on `POST /v1/llm/structured`, whose 240 s-per-lane budget can
 * legitimately reach 32 minutes against a threshold that fired at 5).
 *
 * The budget is DERIVED (`STRUCTURED_LLM_MAX_RUNTIME_MS`), so raising the
 * route's timeout, its retry ceiling, or `llmComplete`'s lane count fails this
 * test instead of silently re-opening the race.
