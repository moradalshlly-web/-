/**
 * THE completion tail for every entity-media job — Character / Face / Object /
 * Creature / Location studios, main images, asset variants and motion clips.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * The entity handlers are their OWN completion writers: they upload to R2,
 * `markJobCompleted` with an entity-shaped `output_data`, commit credits, and
 * then write the result back onto the user's `characters` / `locations` /
 * `objects` / `creatures` row. The generic `finalizeJobWithMedia` does none of
 * those studio writes, which is exactly why all 14 entity job types sat in
 * `NOT_GENERIC_RECOVERABLE`.
 *
 * The cost of that was a silent one: a worker that died between "provider task
 * created" and "result uploaded" left a row the reconcile cron polled, found
 * FINISHED at the provider — and then threw the finished image away, bumped
 * `reconcile_attempts`, and ~90 minutes later force-failed + refunded it. We
 * paid the provider, the user waited an hour and a half, and the asset that
 * existed upstream never reached the studio. Nine production rows in two
 * bursts (2026-09-03, 2026-09-07) are the evidence; by construction EVERY
 * entity job whose worker died mid-flight was unrecoverable.
 *
 * So the completion tail lives here, and BOTH paths call it:
 *  - `workers/handlers/entity.ts` — the live worker, which does NOT take a
 *    finalize claim (it never did: `markJobCompleted`'s CAS plus the
 *    deterministic, idempotently-overwritten R2 key already make the race
 *    benign, and a claim a crashed worker never released would block the cron
 *    for the whole TTL);
 *  - `lib/reconcile/entity-recovery.ts` — the cron (claimant "cron") and the
 *    BullMQ stall re-pick's inline reconcile (claimant "worker"), which DO
 *    claim, because there they are recovering someone else's work.
 *
 * That is the invariant, not a convention: a recovered result completes the
 * job EXACTLY as the worker would have, because it is the same code. The guard
 * is `__tests__/entity-finalize-single-writer.test.ts` — entity.ts may not
 * contain its own `markJobCompleted(` call.
 *
 * ## The attach spec has ONE parser
 *
 * The worker reads the attach fields off `job.data` (the BullMQ payload); the
 * reconciler reads them off `jobs.input_data` (the persisted body). Those are
 * different objects, so `entityAttachSpecFrom` is the single reader for both —
 * and the per-job-type `defaultColumn` below is the single definition of the
 * motion columns the routes used to inline into their queue payloads (which
 * made them invisible to the persisted row, and so unrecoverable).
