/**
 * Per-service margin resolution.
 *
 * The global `cost_markup_percent` admin setting applies one margin to every
 * priced identifier. Some services warrant their own margin instead — the
 * admin sets those in the `service_margin_percent` setting, a map of
 * identifier-prefix → percent (e.g. `{ "some-service": 30 }`), edited in the
 * admin panel and stored in `app_settings`.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY DATA-DRIVEN: this module contains no service names and no
 * percentages — which services carry their own margin, and how much, is
 * runtime configuration living only in the database. Keep it that way.
 *
 * Semantics:
 * - A prefix matches an identifier when they are equal or the identifier
 *   continues with a `:` composite separator (`"svc"` matches `"svc"` and
 *   `"svc:10s"`, never `"svc-other"`).
 * - The LONGEST matching prefix wins, so `"svc:pro"` can carry a different
 *   margin than the broader `"svc"`.
 * - A matched margin REPLACES the global markup for that identifier (override,
 *   not stacking) — the configured number IS the service's margin.
 * - No match → the global `cost_markup_percent` applies unchanged.

/**
 * `base` credits marked up by `percent`, rounded UP to a whole credit — THE

 *
 * Integer-domain on purpose. `Math.ceil(base * (1 + percent / 100))` rounds a
 * float that IEEE-754 can land a hair ABOVE the true value (e.g. 720 × 1.10 =
 * 792.0000000000001 → ceil 793), over-charging by a full credit whenever the
 * exact product is already an integer. `ceil(base * (100 + percent) / 100)`
 * keeps the multiply in integers (72000 + 7200 = 79200, /100 = 792 → ceil 792).
 * Percent is admin-validated to [0, 500], so `percent <= 0` (and `base <= 0`)
 * are the only no-op cases.
 *
 * Reserve, guard, DAG override, per-service margin, the metered settlement, and
 * the anomaly-detector's "actual" all route through this one function, so a
 * reservation can never round differently from the settlement that trues it up
 * — a drift that would manufacture phantom credit anomalies.
