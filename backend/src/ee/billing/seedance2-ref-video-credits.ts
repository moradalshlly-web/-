/**
 * BASE (0%-markup) credit total for a Seedance 2 "with video input" reference run.
 *
 * KIE bills these runs by `unit × (input_video_duration + output_duration)`, but the
 * seeded `-ref` credit composites only encode the per-8s output rate. `commit_credits`
 * can only refund (never up-charge), so we must reserve the correct amount up front —
 * this helper scales the exact per-second base rate by the FULL billed duration
 * (sum of reference-video durations + output duration).
 *
 * The per-second base rate is derived EXACTLY from the seeded 8s `-ref` composite:
 * `perSecBase = STATIC_CREDIT_COSTS["{provider}:8s:{res}-ref"] / 8`
 * (e.g. 720p 50/8 = 6.25, 1080p 124/8 = 15.5, 4k 256/8 = 32, 480p 23/8 = 2.875).
 *
 * `resolution` is clamped to the provider's catalog resolutions (single source of
 * truth) — an unsupported tier (e.g. a stale 1080p on seedance-2-mini, which only
 * exposes 480p/720p) snaps to the model's top priced tier so the looked-up composite
 * is always seeded — mirrors `packages/shared/src/credit-identifiers.ts`.
 *
 * This is the EXACT arithmetic, with no worst-case rule: the reservation side
 * ({@link seedance2RefVideoBaseCreditsFromDurations}) decides what the billed
 * durations are, and the settlement side ({@link seedance2RefVideoActualBaseCredits})
 * feeds it the measured ones.
 *
 * Hard-fail policy: throws `PriceNotConfiguredError` (the same error
 * `getModelCreditBaseCost` throws) when the clamped 8s `-ref` composite is missing.
