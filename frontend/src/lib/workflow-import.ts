/**
 * Reading a workflow JSON blob — the one place the format is understood.
 *
 * Two surfaces import the same files: the editor toolbar (file, clipboard, and
 * its "add to this canvas" mode) and the home screen's Import JSON button. They
 * must agree about what a valid bundle IS, because the disagreement is silent:
 * a second parser that forgets the tutorial wrapper accepts a file the other
 * one rejects, or drops `assets` and lands a workflow whose character chips
 * point at nothing. So the parse rule, the payload shape and the sentences the
 * user reads afterwards live here, and both callers read them from here.
 *
 * Everything below is pure. The network call (`importWorkflow` in `lib/api`)
 * and the toasts stay with the caller, which is what lets the toolbar offer
 * "add to the open canvas" while the home screen only ever creates.
