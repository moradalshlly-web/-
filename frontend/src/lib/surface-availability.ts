/**
 * Browser mirror of the backend's three-layer node/model availability funnel
 * (lib/surface-deny.ts): edition/code → surface-profile factory (allow/deny)
 * → admin runtime override. The static profile in /config.js cannot carry the
 * runtime override, so the dashboard fetches GET /v1/surface/availability once
 * (post-auth) and the picker / model-dropdown filters read the fetched
 * EFFECTIVE denied sets through the two helpers below.
 *
 * REACTIVITY IS LOAD-BEARING, not a nicety. These sets arrive AFTER the first
 * render (one authenticated fetch), and the two consumers — the Add Node
 * picker and the model dropdowns — read them through plain functions during
 * render. Without a subscription nothing re-renders when the data lands, so a
 * deployment with a whitelist showed its users the FULL picker and model
 * lists for the rest of the session: the narrowing silently did nothing in the
 * UI. Components that filter must call `useSurfaceAvailability()`.
 *
 * Before the fetch lands, the helpers fall back to the static profile's
 * explicit `deny` lists only — deliberately NOT the `allow` whitelist
 * inversion, whose gateable-universe scoping (utility nodes exempt) lives
 * backend-side; a brief over-show costs nothing because the backend refuses a
 * denied node/model at write and run regardless. Stock deployments (no allow,
 * no override) render byte-identically with or without the fetch.
 *
 * PER VIEWER. The backend answers for whoever asked: the admin switch hides a
 * node from users, not from admins, so an admin's `denied` omits what the switch
 * withholds and `hiddenFromUsers` names it. The picker needs no admin logic of
 * its own — it shows what is not denied — and `isNodeHiddenFromUsers` only drives
 * the mark that tells an admin "your users cannot see this one". A non-admin
 * always receives an empty list.
