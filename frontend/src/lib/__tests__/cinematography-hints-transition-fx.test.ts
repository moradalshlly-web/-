/**
 * Transition and character-fx now compose from the graph on the DIRECT-WIRE
 * path too — the `cinematography` handle the frontend DAG executor reads
 * through this collector (the backend payload builder mirrors it, covered in
 * backend `label-ref-hint-context.test.ts`).
 *
 * Before this change the collector dispatched them WITHOUT the graph, so a
 * wired `startState` / `endState` / `target` was shown in the config panel's
 * injection preview and on the canvas card — both of which call
 * `getParameterPromptHint(node, { nodes, edges })` — and then silently dropped
 * at execution. The signed-off bound is that an UNWIRED picker is unchanged;
 * the exhaustive per-entry proof of that lives in
 * `packages/prompts/src/__tests__/graph-composed-unwired-identity.test.ts`, and
 * the last case here is its collector-level echo.
 *
 * Every expected string is derived from the catalog composer the picker itself
 * dispatches to — never hand-written — so catalog copy can change freely.
