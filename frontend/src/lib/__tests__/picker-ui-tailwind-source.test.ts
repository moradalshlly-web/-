/**
 * Tailwind v4 skips `node_modules` in its content scan, so `globals.css`
 * re-adds the prebuilt picker-ui bundle with an `@source` directive. NOTHING in
 * the build validates that path: a wrong one fails silently, and the only
 * symptom is that utilities used ONLY inside the package are missing from the
 * emitted CSS. It shipped wrong once (`@nodaroai` instead of `@nodaro`), which
 * stripped the category-tab count badge's horizontal padding and the tile
 * icons' size constraint while every shared utility kept working — so the
 * components looked almost right, which is why it survived review.
 *
 * This pins every `@source` path in the stylesheet to a directory that exists.
