/**
 * A namespaced design token defined in only ONE theme is invisible text for
 * half the users, and nothing catches it at build time — the CSS fallback for
 * an undefined custom property is simply "unset".
 *
 * `copilot-theme-tokens.test.ts` pins that pair for `--copilot-*`, but it reads
 * only the FIRST `:root {` / `.dark {` block in the file. Every design handoff
 * since (`--home-*`, `--integ-*`) carries its OWN block pair further down, so
 * it was never covered — this scans every block and covers each prefix, which
 * means the next handoff's tokens are guarded the day they land rather than
 * the day someone remembers to add them to a list.
 *
 * A token that is deliberately theme-INDEPENDENT (derived from `--primary` via
 * color-mix, say) belongs in `THEME_INDEPENDENT` with the reason — that is a
 * real category, not an exemption for forgetting the dark value.
