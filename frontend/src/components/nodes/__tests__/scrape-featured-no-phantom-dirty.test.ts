/**
 * The scrape nodes (instagram-scrape / meta-ads-scrape) must NEVER auto-persist
 * the DISPLAY featured index.
 *
 * `featuredIndex` is not a `TRANSIENT_RUNTIME_KEY` (it selects which post/ad
 * feeds the output handles), so `updateNodeData({ featuredIndex })` marks the
 * workflow dirty. A render EFFECT that wrote the coerced display value back —
 * to keep the card's shown post in sync with a view-format filter — therefore
 * dirtied the workflow with NO user edit, on mount and on every filter click.
 * On a workflow whose only node is a scrape with a large result that is exactly
 * the phantom-dirty → spurious-save → false "updated on another device" →
 * paused-autosave loop (`node-runtime-keys.test.ts` documents the class).
 *
 * The display coercion (`featured`) stays local; only an explicit user click
 * (`setFeatured`) persists a selection. The output handles read the STORED
 * `featuredIndex` clamped to the full list, so filtering the view is
 * wire-neutral. This guard fails if the auto-write effect is ever re-added.
