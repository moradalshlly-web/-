 * Marks a node the admin switch (Admin → Availability) is hiding from users.
 *
 * An admin still sees and runs such a node; their users do not. Without a mark
 * the two look identical in the picker, and a workflow, app or template built on
 * one would be mistaken for something a user can run — it fails for them with
 * "not available on this deployment". Rendered beside the label wherever a node
 * is offered (picker rows, the sidebar catalogue), the same seats as
 * `NodaroMark`.
 *
 * Self-gating: renders nothing unless the backend named this type in
 * `hiddenFromUsers`, which it only ever does for an admin. Subscribes to the
 * availability store itself, so a row that mounted before the fetch landed
 * still picks the mark up.
