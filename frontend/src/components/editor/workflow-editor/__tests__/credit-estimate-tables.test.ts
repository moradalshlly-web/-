/**
 * `NODE_CREDIT_COSTS` (and its motion-transfer sibling) are the FALLBACK the
 * pre-run estimate uses when the model-cost cache has no entry for a node. They
 * are a second copy of prices whose authority lives in `model_pricing` — so they
 * drift silently, and when they drift the user is quoted a number the run will
 * not actually cost.
 *
 * They drifted exactly that way through the 2026-07-30 ×10 credit
 * re-denomination: the migration swept `STATIC_CREDIT_COSTS`, `model_pricing`,
 * `MODEL_CATALOG` and the video-analysis table, but never touched this file, so
 * every fallback quoted a tenth of the real price. Nothing failed — the estimate
 * is advisory, so there was no crash to notice.
 *
 * This pins the overlap with the catalog, which is the part that CAN be checked
 * from the frontend. It does not cover the node-type-only keys (`generate-image`
 * and friends have no catalog row); those are deliberately rough.
