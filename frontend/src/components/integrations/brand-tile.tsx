/**
 * The square brand mark at the head of every network card.
 *
 * The handoff loads logos from cdn.simpleicons.org. We don't: the community
 * edition is defined by booting with no external dependency at all, and a
 * third-party image request per page view hands that CDN every viewer's IP
 * for nothing. These are the icons the page already shipped with — the
 * redesign's contribution is the tinted tile around them, not the glyph.
 *
 * A network with no icon of its own falls back to a monogram, which is what
 * the handoff itself specifies for the same case. That is also what makes
 * this safe as the registry grows: a network added to the backend appears
 * here with a monogram and correct colours, never a hole.
