# Web Scrape

> Fetch data from web pages, Google Search, Instagram, TikTok, or RSS feeds and emit structured JSON.

## Overview

The Web Scrape node retrieves data from external sources using configurable actors (scrapers). Choose from Google Search for keyword results, a content crawler for page or site Markdown, RSS for feed items, or Instagram/TikTok for post metadata. Output is a structured JSON array that you can pipe into Extract Field, JSON Process, or a List node for fan-out.

## When to Use

- Pull search results into a content generation pipeline
- Scrape a web page and feed its text to Generate Text for summarization
- Fetch recent Instagram or TikTok posts for analysis or remixing
- Combine with Schedule Trigger to run recurring data ingestion workflows

## Configuration

### Source (actor)

| Actor | Label | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `google-search` | Google Search | Returns up to 10 search-result items |
| `content-crawler` | Website Content (Markdown) | Crawls one page or an entire site; emits Markdown |
| `rss` | RSS Feed | Directly fetches and parses an RSS 2.0 or Atom feed (no Apify) |
| `instagram` | Instagram | Retrieves posts from a profile or URL |
| `tiktok` | TikTok | Retrieves posts from a profile or URL |

### Google Search fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| Query | text | — | Search query. Use `{}` to inject an upstream text value |
| Max results | number | 5 | How many results to return (1–10) |
| Country code | text | — | 2-letter ISO country code to localise results (e.g., `us`) |

### Website Content (Markdown) fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| Start URL | text | — | Address of the page or site root, as typed in a browser: `https://` is optional, so `pletor.ai` and `www.pletor.ai/products` both work. Use `{}` to inject upstream |
| Crawl mode | select | `page` | `Single page` — one URL; `Site crawl, up to 20 pages` — follows internal links from the start URL. Each option shows its price |

### RSS fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| Feed URL | text | — | Address of the RSS or Atom feed (`https://` optional) |
| Results limit | number | 10 | Maximum items to return (1–50). Emits `{ title, url, description, pubDate, guid }` per item |

**Supported formats.** Both feed formats are read: **RSS 2.0** (and the older 0.9x / 1.0 shapes) and **Atom** — YouTube channel feeds (`https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=…`), GitHub `releases.atom` and the Atom feed most blog platforms publish. Every item has the same five fields whichever format the feed uses:

| Field | RSS 2.0 (`<item>`) | Atom (`<entry>`) |
|-------|--------------------|------------------|
| `title` | `<title>` | `<title>` |
| `url` | `<link>` | `<link rel="alternate" href>` — a `<link>` with no `rel` counts as the alternate. Otherwise the first link that is not `rel="self"` or `rel="enclosure"`; empty when the entry has no such link |
| `description` | `<description>` | `<summary>`, else `<content>`, else `<media:description>` (where a YouTube entry keeps its text) |
| `pubDate` | `<pubDate>` | `<published>`, else `<updated>` |
| `guid` | `<guid>`, else the `url` | `<id>`, else the `url` |

`pubDate` is normalised to ISO 8601; a date that cannot be parsed is passed through as written. `description` may contain HTML.

**Temporary upstream errors.** When the feed's server drops the connection or answers `408`, `425`, `429` or `5xx`, the fetch is tried again — three requests at most, about a second apart (or as long as the server's `Retry-After` asks, up to 5 seconds), all inside the same 30-second budget — before the run fails. A `404` is tried once more and then treated as final. Any other status fails at once, and so does a server that asks for a longer wait than 5 seconds. A run that uses up the 30 seconds fails with `RSS fetch timed out`, naming the server's last answer.

### Instagram / TikTok fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| Profile or post URL | text | — | Address of the profile or post, with or without `https://` (`instagram.com/nike` works). Use `{}` to inject upstream |
| Results limit | number | 10 | Maximum posts to return (1–20) |

**Availability of the Instagram source.** This source is the same capability as the dedicated [Instagram](instagram-scrape.md) node, so it follows that node's availability: on a deployment where an admin has turned the Instagram node off (Admin → Availability), the Instagram source is withdrawn as well — it disappears from the Source dropdown and a run that uses it is refused with `node_not_available` (`web-scrape:instagram`). A node that was already set to it keeps showing it, tagged *not available*, until you pick another source. Web Scrape's other sources are unaffected.

## Results

After a run, the node card peeks at the first few items and the settings panel's **Results** tab lists them all (with a Raw JSON view, copy and download). Every item links to its source — the search result's page, the feed item, the crawled page, the Instagram post, the TikTok video — and opens in a new tab, so you can judge a result before building on it. Only `http`/`https` addresses become links; anything else a feed returns is shown as text.

## Inputs & Outputs

**Inputs:** Optional upstream connection (used when injecting a value into a field via `{}`).

**Outputs:** `json` — a structured JSON array of result items. Connect to Extract Field or JSON Process to reshape the data.

## Pricing

| SKU | Credits |
|-----|---------|
| Google Search | 30 CR |
| Content Crawler — single page | 10 CR |
| Content Crawler — site crawl | 50 CR |
| Instagram | 10 CR |
| TikTok | 10 CR |
| RSS | 10 CR |

The Run button on the node, the Run button in the panel, the price beside each crawl mode and the Execute-workflow total all show the same figure — the one your account is charged for that run.

A run that fails is refunded in full. A run that finds nothing is a completed run: it is charged, and the node keeps the last good result beside the empty outcome.

For the RSS source, "finds nothing" means a real feed — RSS or Atom — that has no items in it. An address that does not return a feed at all (a web page, an error page, JSON) is an unrecognised document: the run **fails and is refunded**, and the error says what the address returned instead of a feed.

## Long crawls and the API

A site crawl follows up to 20 pages and routinely runs for several minutes — longer than the ~100-second limit on a single HTTP request. In the editor and in a workflow there is nothing to do: both ask for a job and wait for it, and the pages appear on the node when the crawl lands. Reopening a workflow after a crawl finished in the background shows its result too.

A direct API caller chooses how the answer comes back:

- **Job id first (use this for site crawls).** Send `"respondAsync": true` in the body. The route answers `{ "jobId": "…", "status": "pending" }` at once and finishes on the server; read the pages from the completed job's `output_data.json` (`GET /v1/jobs/:id`, or `client.jobs.get(jobId)` in the SDK).
- **Held response (the default).** Without the flag the request stays open until the scrape is done and the result comes back in the response body as `{ "jobId": "…", "json": … }`. Right for a single page, a search or a feed. A crawl that outlasts the request limit is cut off on the way back even though the job completes and is charged — its result is still on the job.

## Common Use Cases

- Search Google for a keyword, extract the top titles, and feed each into a Generate Text node for article drafts
- Crawl a product page and pipe its Markdown to an LLM for structured data extraction
- Pull the latest Instagram posts from a brand account and batch-generate captions for remixes
- Use RSS + Schedule Trigger to build a fully automated daily newsletter pipeline

## Tips

- All actor fields support FieldMapping injection via `{}` so you can drive the query or URL from an upstream Text node.
- For site crawls, the crawler follows internal links up to 20 pages; use `Single page` when you only need one URL's content.
- RSS items contain `title`, `url`, `description`, `pubDate`, and `guid`. Use Extract Field with `title` to pull just the headlines.
- Chain an Extract Field node after Web Scrape to pull a specific property (e.g., `caption` from TikTok, `title` from Google results) before feeding a List node.
