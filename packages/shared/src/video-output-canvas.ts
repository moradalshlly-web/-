/**
 * Real output canvases per (video model, resolution, aspect ratio).
 *
 * Every entry is a pixel size read off a finished render with ffprobe — the
 * geometry a model hands back, never a rate or a price. None of it is
 * arithmetic either, because the providers do not follow arithmetic:
 *
 *   - minimax-h3 at 768P returns 768x1344 (0.5714) for a 9:16 request,
 *   - seedance-2 at 480p 16:9 returns 864x496 (1.742) while seedance-2-5
 *     returns 854x480 (1.778) for the same request,
 *   - grok returns 736x400 (1.84), seedance 1.0 at 1080p 1:1 returns 1440x1440.
 *
 * A formula would get all four wrong, which is why `resolveOutputCanvas`
 * answers `undefined` for anything not measured: callers must then leave the
 * frame alone rather than invent geometry (see `computeFrameFitPlan`).
 *
 * HOW TO EXTEND: run `node tools/harvest-output-canvas.mjs` (it pages the admin
 * jobs API, groups completed video jobs by provider/resolution/aspect and probes
 * real outputs) and paste new rows here. Take rows from REFERENCE or
 * TEXT-TO-VIDEO jobs only: in frame mode the adaptive models (the seedance and
 * wan families) size the output from the INPUT image, so those rows describe the
 * input that was sent, not the canvas the model would choose on its own.
 *
 * Seeded 2026-09-16 from 3000 completed production jobs.
