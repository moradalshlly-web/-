/**
 * START/END FRAME FIT — the pure geometry half.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (measured on ~40 production renders, 2026-09-16):
 * a start frame whose pixel size is not the model's own output canvas gets
 * reshaped by the provider, and Seedance 2.5 does it VISIBLY — frame 0 is the
 * user's image verbatim, then from frame 1 the generated frames are rescaled
 * ~2% on ONE axis (x1.000 y1.02). Five of ten runs with a 940x1672 image
 * snapped; three of three with the same image resized to 720x1280 did not.
 *
 * So: reshape the frame ourselves, to the size the model was going to render
 * anyway. The canvas comes from measurement (`video-output-canvas.ts`), never
 * from arithmetic, and when a combination has never been measured the fit
 * DEGRADES rather than guesses.
 *
 * This module is pure — no I/O, no sharp, no network. `prepareVideoFrames` in
 * the backend does the pixels and the upload.
