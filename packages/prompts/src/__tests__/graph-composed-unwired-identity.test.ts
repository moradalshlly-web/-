/**
 * THE BOUND ON "compose transition and character-fx from the graph on every
 * path", as a proof rather than a claim.
 *
 * Transition and character-fx joined `EXECUTION_GRAPH_COMPOSED_PARAMETER_TYPES`
 * (@nodaro/shared) and `LABEL_REF_GRAPH_COMPOSED_PARAMETER_TYPES` (backend
 * `services/workflow-engine/label-ref-hint-context.ts`), so every executor now
 * hands them the graph. That deliberately changes the prompt of a workflow that
 * WIRES them — signed off, and the new text is the text the picker's own
 * injection preview has always shown.
 *
 * What was signed off with it is the BOUND: a picker with nothing wired to its
 * own composing handles (`startState` / `endState` for transition, `target` for
 * character-fx) must emit BYTE-IDENTICAL text with and without the graph, so a
 * workflow that wires nothing cannot move at all. This file walks every entry
 * of both catalogs, in both hint modes, under two unwired graph shapes, and
 * asserts that equality — then proves it is not vacuous with wired positive
 * controls that MUST differ.
 *
 * Why two unwired shapes: "unwired" in a real workflow does not mean an
 * isolated node. The picker is normally wired INTO a consumer (an outgoing
 * `cinematography` edge) while nothing feeds its own handles — the walker in
 * `resolveParameterHint` only ever looks at edges whose TARGET is the picker,
 * and this pins that.
