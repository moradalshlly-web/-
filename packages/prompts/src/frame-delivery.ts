/**
 * HOW A START/END FRAME TRAVELS — one plan, read by both ends.
 *
 * A frame can reach a model two ways: as a real frame, or as a reference image
 * bound in prose as the opening (or closing) frame. Which one is right is
 * measured per model — the Seedance 2.0 family crop-zooms a frame 2% and drifts
 * 11-26% darker within six frames, but holds its look from frame 0 when the same
 * image rides as a reference; every other model measured reproduces the opening
 * frame better as a frame (see `resolveFrameDelivery` in @nodaro/shared).
 *
 * The composition — where the frames sit in the reference list, which sentence
 * binds them, when the switch is refused — lives HERE rather than at the
 * dispatch site, because two places need the same answer:
 *
 *   - `backend/src/lib/video-frame-dispatch.ts` builds the actual request,
 *   - the editor's config panel tells the user which mode their node will run in.
 *
 * When those two disagree the panel lies, which is worse than having no panel
 * text at all. One function, two callers, no drift.

 * Two refusals, both deliberate:
 *   - a model with no reference-image support keeps frame mode (there is nowhere
 *     for the frame to go);
 *   - a switch that would push past the model's image cap keeps frame mode,
 *     because the alternative is dropping one of the USER's reference images to
 *     make room for ours.
 *
 * The frames are appended AFTER the user's own images so their `@image_N`
 * ordinals never shift, and the opening sentence is skipped when the prompt
 * already binds its own first frame — a second binding at another position
 * dilutes the first back into coin-flip behaviour (field finding 2026-07-20).
