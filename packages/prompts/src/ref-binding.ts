 * pair-back bullet, and the opening/closing frame directive — MUST go through
 * these five arrows. The default form is `@image_N`; if the D7 probe shows a
 * provider prefers the legacy `Image N` form, flipping is editing ONLY these five
 * arrows (`@image_${n}` → `Image ${n}`), nothing downstream.
 *
 * This IS the live swap-point: `resolveVideoReferenceCore` routes the per-image
 * subject phrasing, the "Use these characters" / pair-back bullet ordinals, and
 * the frame directive through these arrows, and `resolveReferenceTokens` resolves
 * the body `{image:N}` tokens through `REF_BINDING[kind]` — so the five arrows
 * are the ONLY emission sites for the binding surface string.
